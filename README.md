# BeerMe
An application that uses your geolocation to pinpoint the nearest places for you to find a beer.

## How to Use

Sign in, or create a secure account, and **BeerMe** will use HTML5's built-in geolocator to determine your current location. **BeerMe** will then use your location to make an API call to [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) and return 30 nearby venues for you to purchase a beer.

Venue information includes it's name, address, phone, web address, and current popularity--based on realtime [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) check-ins.

You can also view a map of the location and receive directions to the venue from your current location using the [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) API.

If you visited and enjoyed a particular venue, or want to save a location for future visits, you can store the venue's information on a personalized *favorites* page.
